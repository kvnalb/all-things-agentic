"""Canvas -> Pub/Sub bridge.

The ambient-expense sample is triggered by expenses arriving on a Pub/Sub
topic. Canvas doesn't push to Pub/Sub, so this poller is the bridge: it reads
your bCourses assignments, converts each to a Task, and publishes the NEW ones
to the same topic the agent listens on.

Run it two ways:
  - Locally / on a loop for dev (python -m taskmaster_agent.canvas_poller)
  - As a Cloud Run job triggered by Cloud Scheduler in production (this is the
    'runs in the background autonomously' story for the demo).

Env vars:
  CANVAS_BASE_URL   e.g. https://bcourses.berkeley.edu
  CANVAS_TOKEN      your personal access token (bCourses > Account > Settings)
  PUBSUB_TOPIC      full topic path, or leave unset to just print (dev mode)
  GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT   needed only when publishing to Pub/Sub
